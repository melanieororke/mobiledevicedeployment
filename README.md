MDD1305 - Easy Keeper - Stable Management Mobile App
====================================================

Please Notice:

This is a project, designed and developed by myself for the Mobile Media Deployment project in Full Sail University's Web
Design and Development Bachelors program. While the app is meant to be a fully functional application for mobile devices, it
is a class project and is not intended for real world use at this time. If you have any questions, comments or concerns 
about this project, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:melanieororke@fullsail.edu">melanieororke@fullsail.edu</a>.


<b>Also please know that if this application was deployed in the real world, member profiles would not be included. Each stable/farm would 
have their own copy of the application and it would not interact with others. The horse world is very competitive and sharing
such things as health and feed records is generally not done. Imagine if your prize racehorse had a stone bruise and every 
one in the world knew about it as soon as it happened. This would be incredibly detrimental to the horse and the people
associated with the horse. Some things don't need to be publicized, plus, there are plenty of social networks in the world.</b>

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This project is built on Twitter's Bootstrap framework. All SQL tables will be built on my personal server (until told otherwise)
and SQL updates will be recorded in the appropriate folder (sqlUpdates) for the purposes of this project. For all CSS, JS, or images, please look in the corresponding assets folder.

The purpose of this app is to allow barn managers easy access to information about horses in their care. It will include 
feed schedules, vetrinarian and farrier (horse shoeing) appointments as well as show and riding schedules. It will also
have areas for notes about each horse from grooms, trainers and other individuals that may come in contact with the horse.
