MDD1305 - Easy Keeper - Stable Management Mobile App
====================================================

Please Notice:

This is a project, designed and developed by myself for the Mobile Media Deployment project in Full Sail University's Web
Design and Development Bachelors program. While the app is meant to be a fully functional application for mobile devices, it
is a class project and is not intended for real world use at this time. If you have any questions, comments or concerns 
about this project, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:melanieororke@fullsail.edu">melanieororke@fullsail.edu</a>.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This project is built on Twitter's Bootstrap framework. All SQL tables will be built on my personal server (until told otherwise)
and SQL updates will be recorded in the appropriate folder (sqlUpdates) for the purposes of this project. For all CSS, JS, or images, please look in the corresponding assets folder.

The purpose of this app is to allow barn managers easy access to information about horses in their care. It will include 
feed schedules, vetrinarian and farrier (horse shoeing) appointments as well as show and riding schedules. It will also
have areas for notes about each horse from grooms, trainers and other individuals that may come in contact with the horse.
